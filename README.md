# Expression Calculator

## Project Description:
The Expression Calculator project focuses on building a calculator using HTML Canvas, enabling users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. The calculator allows users to construct and evaluate expressions. The primary objective is to gain hands-on experience with the JavaScript Canvas API, enhancing skills in web development.

## Technologies Used:
1. HTML Canvas
2. JavaScript

## Instructions to Run the Project Locally:
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
>git clone <repository_url>
2. Open the project in VS Code or your preferred IDE.
3. Add the Live Server extension to your IDE to run the project.

## Steps to Push Changes to Remote Branch:
If you need to push changes to the remote branch, follow these steps:

1. Add changes to your local branch:
>git add .
2. Commit changes with an appropriate message:
>git commit -m "Give appropriate message"
3. Push changes to the global branch:
>git push origin main

## User Requirements:
1. Evaluate an expression using the calculator when the "=" button is clicked.
2. Delete a character in the expression using the "Back" button.
3. See an "Invalid Expression" error message in the value field when the expression is malformed.
4. Use "+ (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), % (modulus)" arithmetic operators to construct the expression.
